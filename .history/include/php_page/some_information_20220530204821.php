                    Traditional marriage, man and woman, live together under one roof, and this makes them different
                    from the other under one framework, and this makes them become the main source of procreation of
                    children and the preservation of offspring, regardless of other reasons, regardless of other
                    reasons, except the relationship of the royal family, or the Royal family. She starts getting
                    acquainted and ends with marriage

                    At the outset, it is necessary to mention an important issue, which is that the young man and the
                    girl in this type of marriage often never see each other before the acquaintance that precedes this
                    step. It is known as (the marriage of salons), after which the stages of marriage begin, which are:

                </p>
                <p>
                    This stage is based on a meeting that brings together the families of the groom and the bride at the
                    home of the bride’s family, where the father of the groom formally requests the bride’s hand for his
                    son, then the groom and the bride choose their representative to start the conversation, and the
                    groom’s representative or his agent answers the questions posed by the bride’s agent regarding the
                    status of the bride The groom’s economic and social capabilities, as well as his plans for the
                    future, after which the bride’s agent decides whether to accept or reject the marriage, and
                    sometimes asks for a time limit to respond to the groom’s family’s request.

                <h5>Engagement Party</h5>
                <p>
                    The courtship period is one of the most beautiful moments that two people may live, especially if
                    neither of them knew the other before the engagement. This step is done.

                    Engagement takes place through several stages that the fiancé and his relatives go through on the
                    one hand, and the fiancée and her family on the other hand, which are as follows:


                </p>
                <p>
                    It begins with the mother, sisters and any of the suitor’s relatives going to the girl’s house, so
                    that the stage of acquaintance between the women, and the suitor may go with them to see the girl,
                    and the suitor may go with his family as his father and mother, and all this is done according to
                    the customs of the people, and the habits of the girl’s family, and there may be multiple sessions
                    Acquaintance, whereby the suitor is known about his work, studies, income, and residence, and the
                    young man and girl sit with each other and talk together to get to know each other closely.

                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
                    when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                    distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
                    readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their
                    default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
                    infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
                    (injected humour and the like).
