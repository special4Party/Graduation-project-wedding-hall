                <p>
                    Traditional marriage, man and woman, live together under one roof, and this makes them different
                    from the other under one framework, and this makes them become the main source of procreation of
                    children and the preservation of offspring, regardless of other reasons, regardless of other
                    reasons, except the relationship of the royal family, or the Royal family. She starts getting
                    acquainted and ends with marriage

                    At the outset, it is necessary to mention an important issue, which is that the young man and the
                    girl in this type of marriage often never see each other before the acquaintance that precedes this
                    step. It is known as (the marriage of salons), after which the stages of marriage begin, which are:

                </p>
                <p>
                    This stage is based on a meeting that brings together the families of the groom and the bride at the
                    home of the bride’s family, where the father of the groom formally requests the bride’s hand for his
                    son, then the groom and the bride choose their representative to start the conversation, and the
                    groom’s representative or his agent answers the questions posed by the bride’s agent regarding the
                    status of the bride The groom’s economic and social capabilities, as well as his plans for the
                    future, after which the bride’s agent decides whether to accept or reject the marriage, and
                    sometimes asks for a time limit to respond to the groom’s family’s request.

                <h5>Engagement Party</h5>
                <p>
                    The courtship period is one of the most beautiful moments that two people may live, especially if
                    neither of them knew the other before the engagement. This step is done.
                    This type of party is referred to in great numbers to attend, in addition to those events that need
                    to attend and arrange events, as well as for the United Nations, as well as events and their
                    arrangement, as well as people who wish to attend them.

                    become special.

                    Engagement takes place through several stages that the fiancé and his relatives go through on the
                    one hand, and the fiancée and her family on the other hand, which are as follows:


                </p>
                <p>
                    It begins with the mother, sisters and any of the suitor’s relatives going to the girl’s house, so
                    that the stage of acquaintance between the women, and the suitor may go with them to see the girl,
                    and the suitor may go with his family as his father and mother, and all this is done according to

                <p>
                    This type of party is attended by a small number of people invited, in addition to the fact that
                    these parties do not need the same amount of planning as large-sized parties, but despite that they
                    definitely need to follow and take care of the party system by people their supervisors.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Small-sized parties are among the most highly private parties, and for this reason, great care must
                    be taken that the list of people who have been invited is small in size, and it must also be
                    confirmed by the people supervising the preparation and organization of the party. They must also
                    make sure that the party is not entered by strangers who are not invited, in order to ensure the
                    regularity of the party and the lack of space constraints.

                    Training on how to present the ceremony is one of the most important things about the ceremony,
                    especially in large-sized parties because in reality many people will go to it. For this reason,
                    attention should be paid to many training things, including: making sure that the private place
                    Dance enough, take care that the party lighting is regular.
